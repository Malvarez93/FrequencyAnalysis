# Frequency Analysis

Notebooks and scripts to perform frequency analysis of water resources related data.
* The Notebook "Distribution Fitting" fits a maximum yearly precipitation or discharge data series to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and presents plots on the fit of the distribution as well as estimation for design values for several return periods. A 95% confidence interval is computed using a parametric bootstrap.
